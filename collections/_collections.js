// YOU CAN SAFELY DELETE THIS FILE
// This file is only there to ensure that the external directory
// will be commitable. GIT does not allow to commit empty directory.
// We could use an empty .gitignore too.

// Collections
// The collection directory contains definitions of collections
// and methods on them (could be /models)
